== The Tanglu Archive Control Files ==
Tanglu Archive Admins and automatic services can control stuff which enters the archive
and gets deleted from it by using britney hints files, or by blocking the import of
certain packages from Debian.
It is also possible to advise the janitor not to remove a certain package, even if he thinks
that the package is cruft.

Please be VERY careful when making changes to these files! There is a high chance that you
might break something.
Only Tanglu archive admins and assistants should have access to this repository.
