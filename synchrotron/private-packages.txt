# List of Tanglu-exclusive (native) packages
#
# This list contains packages which are specific to Tanglu and should therefore not
# be included in the sychrotron cruft reports and be dealt with separately when creating
# divergence reports for Tanglu.

# automatically and do not need to be added to this list.
