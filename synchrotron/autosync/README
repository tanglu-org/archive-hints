## Tanglu synchrotron permanent sync freeze exceptions

The lists in this directory contain packages which should be permanently automatically synced,
although a Debian import freeze is currently active.
They can also be used to perma-sync packages from suites other than the default
automatic import suite (testing).

Tanglu developers can manually sync stuff from Debian at any time! Please do
only add packages here which should be auto-synced.
