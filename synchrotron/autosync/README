## Tanglu synchrotron permanent sync freeze exceptions

This directory contains symlinks to package set lists in ../sets/.
The sets linked to this directory will be permanently automatically synced,
even if a Debian import freeze is currently active.
They can also be used to perma-sync packages from suites other than the default
automatic import suite (testing).

Tanglu developers can manually sync stuff from Debian at any time! Please do
only symlink package sets here which should be constantly auto-synced.
